uClinux TOOLS
-------------

No compiler tools are provided in the uClinux source distribution.
You need to either get a pre-built binary package from www.uclinux.org,
or compile yourself a cross tool chain.

You will need:

    GNU gcc      (currently we use 2.95.3)
    GNU binutils (currently we use 2.10)
    GNU gdb      (currently we use 5.0)
    elf2flt


Makefile.release
-----------------
- Makefile for creating *release* version of SDK.
- This will remove all the "protected" (things we don't want the customers to see) files,
  as well as CVS/tmp/image files.

Usage:

In the uClinux-dist directory, type:

# make -f tools/Makefile.release all
