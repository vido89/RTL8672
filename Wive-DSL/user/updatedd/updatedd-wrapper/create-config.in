# below are the configurations of your services...
#
# Each block has to start with SERVICE(active OR disabled)
#
# Example:
#
# ovh(active)    	Ovh is the name of the service, this can be set
#			to active like here or to disabled.
#			If it is set to disabled the following block will be ignored.
#
# A block has to include the following arguments:
#
#	login		your name for the login specified at 'login { }'
#
#	hostnames	your hostnames without `http://'
#			(space seperated and use quotations marks!)
#
# The following options can be included:
#
#	ip-addr		ipv4:`/path/to/script` OR ipv6:`/path/to/script`
#			The script should print the ip address to stdout. This
#			option is highly recommend, because
#			the ip address won't be cached without it!
#			See $prefix/share/updatedd/ for additional scripts.
#
#	use-syslog	print messages to syslog (yes or no, default is yes)
#
#	options		extra options for the service
#			(see 'updatedd <service> -- --help' for help)
#
#	force		this will force the update of your ddns record
#			(cache entries will be ignored)
#
# Notice that a block for a service can appear more than once!
#
# Please refer to the updatedd documentation (http://updatedd.philippp-benner.de).
